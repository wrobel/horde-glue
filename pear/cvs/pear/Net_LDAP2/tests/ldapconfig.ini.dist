; | This is a configuration file for Net_LDAP2s tests.                        |
; | To activate the tests, you need to adjust the configuration to            |
; | your needs and copy it over to "ldapconfig.conf". Place the               |
; | file inside the directory holding all the test programs.                  |
; |                                                                           |
; | Note, that this tests assume a working LDAP server.                       |
; | If you don't have such a server, you may use the                          |
; | LDIF based mock server. Head to 'ldapldifconfig.ini.dist'.                |
; |                                                                           |
; | The syntax of this file is really easy and similar to other .ini-files.   |
; | Remember to quote strings containing non-alphanumeric characters.         |
